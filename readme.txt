README file for supplementary material associated with the article: "Bounds and self-consistent
estimates of the elastic constants of polycrystals" by Christopher M. Kube, Andrea P. Arguelles

Supplementary files included: bounds.m, analysis.m

Both m-files include functions to be executed from the Matlab command window. However, no 
Matlab-exclusive functions are required for the execution of the routine, so that the functions 
can be easily adapted to other programming languages. 

Detailed instructions for the execution of each function are included as comments within the code.
